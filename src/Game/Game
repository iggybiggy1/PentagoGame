        -r : real player - sets the type of both players as real
        -c : connect to a server - connects to a server on a given port
        -s : start a server - starts the server and makes creator as the first client
        -h : help menu - prints help menu at any given time
        -q : quit - quits the game (potentially terminating connection with the server)

2. For options -d, -s, -r, this is the desired flow:

        Please provide the name for the (real) player 2 BLACK:
        "Example name"

        Deciding which player starts:
        Turn of player 2:

        Provide coordinate x: "example coordinate 1"
        Provide coordinate y: "example coordinate 2"

    -d : dummy player - invokes dummy player for the game
    -s : smart player - invokes smart player for the game
    -r : real player - sets the type of both players as real
    -c : connect to a server - connects to a server on a given port
    -s : start a server - starts the server and makes creator as the first client
    -h : help menu - prints help menu at any given time
    -q : quit - quits the game (potentially terminating connection with the server)


5. If at any given moment parameters -h, -q are chosen then:
    -h : will print the menu (we will see if this is even useful)
    -q : will terminate the connection, and end the game. Will turn off the system
